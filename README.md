Test Driven Development claims to : 
* **Reduce Hacking** & going down **Rabbit Holes**
* Give Clear guidelines for **"What should I do next"**
* Give Clear **status report for the Team**
* Reducte **debug time**
* Give very high **test coverage** ~90%
* Give Complete, reliable, feature/API-level **documentation**
* Give Improved decoupled testable **design**
* Give Code that is always **working a minute ago**
* Allow **fearless refactoring** of code to **avoid code rot**

In short it is important stuff, that should be in your skill set :)
